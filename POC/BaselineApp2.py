'''
Naive baseline implementation to solve the problem of maintaining active paths in streaming graphs

1) Generate a small-world graph G with params: n: number of nodes, p: edge wiring probability, k: number of neighbors

2) Keep original graph in memory, and save it as adjacency list in in corresponding *.txt file for future reference

3) Generate synthetic data by creating paths through a random walk on graph G.
   Start at a node picked uniformly at random, for each iteration, there is probability 'alpha' of choosing a neighbor
   and a probability 'beta = 1 - alpha' of stopping

4) Each path is from time [t, t'] where t' can be adjusted with param k.

5) An input file is then generated based on the paths

6) For each time step, an active graph is generated and stored as adjacency list in a *.txt file

7) The files can now be used to generated the connected components of each active graph
   by specifying the filename and executing python3 genConnected.py

# TODO:
# - Documentation
# - Prepare presentation and report in this order:
#       motivation
#       positioning
#       actual problem
#       different approaches
#       evaluations
#
# Work flow:
# 1) Create random walks file and its details
#   a) Include: Length of random walk, duration of random walk, average shortest path
#   b) Eliminate having sub paths like: [a b c] and [a b c d]
#   c) length of random walk should be 4 if alpha = 0.8
# 2) Create a file showing each time step and its list of paths
# 3) Create a matrix input file
# 4) Repeat the process for the same graph to end up with 3 different input matrix files
# 5) Input: one of the different matrix files, Output: Try to recreate the (each time step, list of paths) file
#   a) you have the graph and you have to find the active nodes by dfs and bfs.
#   b) if you find 1 active then find the active neighboursâ€¦etc.
#   c) start from an active node do i have n=other active nodes? no: stop. yes: go to the neighbour and keep going
#   d) if you have a case for an active nodes, you have more than 1 active neighbour
#      it could be a cross path between two paths? need to think about it and draw it
